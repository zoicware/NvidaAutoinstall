# Nvidia Autoinstall by Zoic

This powershell script will allow you to install and tweak your preferred Nvidia driver all in one. The script will show the 4 newest drivers but if you would like to install one that is not listed just type in the version number.
You can choose to strip the driver where only the bare driver is installed and does not include GEforceExperience. Once the driver is installed you can further tweak it by importing optimized settings for gaming, enable msi mode for your gpu
set digital vibrance for all your monitors and enable legacy sharpen in the NVCP.

Once you download the zip extract the contents anywhere on the c drive and run the script

I recommend using ddu in safe mode before installing any new driver

(digital vibrance will need a restart to take effect)
(HDCP and telemetry are automatically disabled as no one wants that)
